Aardwolf is a remote JavaScript debugger for Android/iOS and is written in JavaScript.

It consists of the following parts:
- a code rewriter which injects debug info into your existing source code
- a debug library which can break execution of your scripts, report execution progress, evaluate code, etc.
- a UI for setting breakpoints, stepping through code and seeing the current position within the script
- a server for communication between the debug library and the UI


In order to run the server and the code rewriter you will need Node.js:
