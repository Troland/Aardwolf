Aardwolf is a remote JavaScript debugger for Android/iOS/WindowsPhone7 and is written in JavaScript.
It's available under the MIT license.

Home page: http://lexandera.com/aardwolf/

Currently it supports:
- breakpoints
- code evaluation at breakpoint
- break on next
- step/continue execution control
- stack listing
- exception reporting (also for exceptions thrown in async calls)
- JavaScript console remoting


It consists of the following parts:
- a server for communication between the mobile device and the UI
- a code rewriter which injects debug info into your existing source code
- a debug library which can break execution of your scripts, report execution progress, evaluate code, etc.
- a UI for setting breakpoints, stepping through code and seeing the current position within the script


In order to run the examples you will need:
- Node.js. Get it here: http://nodejs.org/#download
- An Android 2.x/iOS/WindowsPhone7 device or emulator. (although running them from a Firefox/Chrome/Safari window will also work...)


Setting it up:
- Download the source code.
- Create the file config/config.local.js and paste into it the following lines:

    var config = require('../config/config.defaults.js');
    config.serverHost = 'ip-or-hostname-of-your-computer';

- Make sure that access to the port 8500 on your computer is not blocked by a firewall and that the 
  address you entered into the config file in the previous step can really be accessed from your 
  phone. This is where your phone will load the samples from, so it must work.
- Start the server by running "node app.js"
- After the server starts up, open http://localhost:8000 in your desktop browser. The debugger UI should appear.
- Open http://ip-or-hostname-of-your-computer:8500/calc.html on your phone and wait for the page to load.
  The line "Mobile device connected." should appear in the UI's output pane.
- You're now debugging the "calculator" example script.
